# VanLife 

This repository contains my learning project built while following the **Scrimba course: "Learn React Router 6"** by **Bob Ziroll**.  
The project is called **VanLife** a fictional van rental web app that helps users browse, learn about, and manage rental vans for trips and travelling.

## About the VanLife Project

**VanLife** is a multi-page React application built to demonstrate the power of **React Router**.

In the project, a van rental platform where users can:
- View a homepage and learn about the company
- Browse a list of available vans to rent
- Click on a van to view detailed information
- Navigate between different pages using routes
- Use dynamic URLs to load van-specific data
- Manage a "host dashboard" area with nested routes and protected pages

## What I Learned
- How to configure React Router with `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Routes>`, and `<Route>`
- Setting up static and dynamic routes
- Creating nested layouts and using `Outlet`
- Using `useParams` hook
- Implementing route protection with a mock auth system
- Organizing routes with layout and dashboard structure
